Diary Entry Week of 18 May - Tomas Donovic
The previous week, only limited progress has been made.
We have done a bit of work protoyping the UI and tring to get that side of things working.
This mostly consisted of us re-designing the structure of our program since far too much was left in main and not in separete discrete funcitons.
UI headway was made, buttons were made to enter actions into our CLI, which is some progress, although not enough for this stage.

This week will mostly deal with trying to get the UI finished, since that is the bare minimum to expect for this stage.
